This paper is provided as a  [Quarto document](https://quarto.org/).

This has some advantages:

* You can see all the code used to generate the figures. Because this document is a review of SSVEP methods, this provides a useful introduction to SSVEP analysis. All this code is available under the MIT license.

* You can recompile the paper into any format you like - PDF, Word etc.. 

* You can check the code used to make the paper. Perhaps we made some mistakes? Feel free to fork and fix. 

* More generally, this is an example of ["Computational Reproducibility"](https://open.lnu.se/index.php/metapsychology/article/view/4021) - something that we think would help academic publishing.
